# You Are The Virus

### Gameplay

You start out as a single virus, who lives only from destroying innocent cells. To kill cells, simply move on top of them until they die. Your virus will duplicate itself depending on the size of the cell you kill.

Cells will continually grow and split, gaining more health as they grow in size. You need to stop this before it gets out of hand, and there are too many entities on the screen for your computer to render.

Be careful not to let your viruses die, they lose health over time, and can only be regained with their lifesteal when damaging other cells.

### Controls

* Left click and drag to select units, then right click anywhere to move them
* Add/Subtract or I/O to zoom in and out
* Arrow keys to pan

### Future Plans

Unfortunately I ran out of time to implement an important balancing feature: Antibodies.
These would have formed inside of cells and they would attack and kill your viruses when entering. The only way to stop these is to use larger groups of viruses to quickly kill the entire cell along with the antibodies.
